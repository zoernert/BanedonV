- **Performance at scale** (hundreds of collections, thousands of files)
- **Edge cases** (empty states, error conditions)
- **Different user types** (admin, power user, beginner)
- **Proper API response simulation** (delays, errors, success states)

### Mock Services Architecture:
```
lib/mock/
â”œâ”€â”€ mock-auth.ts          # Authentication simulation
â”œâ”€â”€ mock-api.ts           # API response simulation
â”œâ”€â”€ mock-data.ts          # Core data generators
â”œâ”€â”€ mock-analytics.ts     # Analytics data
â”œâ”€â”€ mock-billing.ts       # Billing operations
â”œâ”€â”€ mock-collections.ts   # Collection management
